## Problem Set 4

In this problem set, you'll implement two versions of a wordgame!
Let's begin by describing the 6.00 wordgame: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.

### The rules of the game are as follows:

Dealing
A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7 for now).
The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, using each letter at most once.
Some letters may remain unused (these won't be scored).

Scoring
The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.
The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first word created.
Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.
For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!
As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all n letters).

#### Problem 1 - Word Scores
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate the score for a single word. The function getWordScore should accept as input a string of lowercase letters (a word) and return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules.

#### Problem 2 - Dealing with Hands
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Implement the updateHand function. Make sure this function has no side effects: i.e., it must not mutate the hand passed in. Before pasting your function definition here, be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py.

#### Problem 3 - Valid Words
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and display that hand to the user. We can also ask the user for a word (Python's input) and score the word (using your getWordScore). However, at this point we have not written any code to verify that a word given by a player obeys the rules of the game. A valid word is in the word list; and it is composed entirely of letters from the current hand. Implement the isValidWord function.

Testing: Make sure the test_isValidWord tests pass. In addition, you will want to test your implementation by calling it multiple times on the same hand - what should the correct behavior be? Additionally, the empty string ('') is not a valid word - if you code this function correctly, you shouldn't need an additional check for this condition.

Fill in the code for isValidWord in ps4a.py and be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py before pasting your function definition here.

#### Problem 4 - Hand Length
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. We'll be implementing the playHand function. This function allows the user to play out a single hand. First, though, you'll need to implement the helper calculateHandlen function, which can be done in under five lines of code.

#### Problem 5 - Playing a Hand
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
In ps4a.py, note that in the function playHand, there is a bunch of pseudocode. This pseudocode is provided to help guide you in writing your function. Check out the Why Pseudocode? resource to learn more about the What and Why of Pseudocode before you start coding your solution.


#### Problem 6 - Playing a Game
15.0/15.0 points (graded)
A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code that implements the playGame function. You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the playGame body. Read through the specification and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand.


#### Problem 7 - You and your Computer
20.0/20.0 points (graded)
Now that your computer can choose a word, you need to give the computer the option to play. Write the code that re-implements the playGame function. You will modify the function to behave as described below in the function's comments. As before, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand. Be sure to try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program.
